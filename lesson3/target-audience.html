      <h4>Scenario 2:</h4>
      <p>Erol is a farmer and sheep breeder that is currently suffering of irrigation problems. His irrigators failed recently, causing a shortage of fresh grass to feed their sheep. He needs help with fixing his irrigators, so he wants to access the network in the Chamber by joining it.</p>
      <h4>Scenario 3:</h4>
      <p>The Cha-cha festival date is approaching. Sadly, the two past years attendace was low due to the pandemic.

      <h4>Scenario 4:</h4>

      <h4>Scenario 5:</h4>
